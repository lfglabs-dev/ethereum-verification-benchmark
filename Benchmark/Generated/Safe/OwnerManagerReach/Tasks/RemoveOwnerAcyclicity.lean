removeOwner preserves acyclicity of the owner linked list.

Acyclicity is a tautology — it holds for any state. The proof
(acyclic_generic) shows that any duplicate-free chain from SENTINEL's
successor ending at key ≠ SENTINEL cannot contain SENTINEL, purely
by the structure of the definitions. No pre-state acyclicity hypothesis
is needed.
